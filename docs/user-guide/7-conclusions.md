# 7   Conclusions

Walkabout performs random walk particle tracking simulations on structured or fully unstructured grids. It is designed to work with LaGrit, FEHM and PLUMECALC. Based on verification and acceptance test results shown here, Walkabout Version 1 is sufficiently developed and tested to deploy in radionuclide transport calculations.
