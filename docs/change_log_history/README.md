  Summary: Ethan created a new repo (no history) from the source code at the end of Lucia’s repo to try to reconfigure the search algorithm.

  * walkabout_shane.glog: <br />
  Summary: Latest code from Shane that, where he created a new repo starting from his work on Soumi’s code to pass the Walkabout test suite.
