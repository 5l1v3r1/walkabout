walkabout_ecoon.glog:
Summary: Ethan created a new repo (no history) from the source code at the end of Lucia’s repo to try to reconfigure the search algorithm. He did implement new search algorithms and provided a test suite for this code that tests the algorithms independently of the rest of walkabout. However, Ethan’s code does not pass the Walkabout test suite.

walkabout_shane.glog:
Summary: Latest code from Shane that, where he created a new repo starting from his work on Soumi’s code to pass the Walkabout test suite. This version does pass all tests in the test suite, contains Soumi’s OpenMP parallelization, but does seem to have some problems on some of Zhiming’s problems. This is the current version.
