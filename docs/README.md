# Documentation - Walkabout (V1)
### Approved for public release; LA-UR-11-01952

New repository starting from a debugged version of Soumi’s code (passes the Walkabout test suite). Contains Soumi’s OpenMP parallelization. This is the current version. <br />
Contains issues (noted in issues section) to be resolved before further development; however, this is the best version to move forward with. <br />
Test Suite compares results to Scott Painter's code, which does not contain Amanzi compatability. <br />
