Walkabout performs random walk particle tracking simulations

to build walkabout: cd src; make

This creates *.o, *.mod, *.walkabout files.

Move them to the build folder of your choice. I use build_<your machine name> convention, where <your machine name> is the name of the machine you build the walkabout on.
