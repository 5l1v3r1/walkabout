NOTICE OF OSS COPYRIGHT ASSERTION:

LANS has asserted copyright on the software package entitled Walkabout, Version 1.0 beta (C11063). 

ABSTRACT
Walkabout simulates the movement of flow tracers or passive solutes in the subsurface. The random walk particle-tracking algorithm is used. A unique aspect of the code is the ability to accommodate fully unstructured control volume grids. Two classes of applications are envisioned: assessments of risks associated with migrating contaminants in the subsurface and establishing flow streamlines for use in petroleum reservoir simulation.

This code is unclassified and has been assigned LA-CC-11-033. Los Alamos National Laboratoryâ€™s Export Control Team made an in-house determination that this software is controlled under Department of Commerce regulations and the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) EAR99. The export control review is attached.

The developers intend to distribute this software package under the OSI Certified BSD 3-Clause License (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)

The development of the Walkabout, Version 1.0 beta software was funded from the Underground Test Area (UGTA) Activity under the following B&R code: YN0100000. Bill Wilborn, Program Manager has granted his concurrence to asserting copyright and then distributing the Walkabout, Version 1.0 beta code using an open source software license. See attached memo.

LANS acknowledges that it will comply with the DOE OSS policy as follows: 

a.  submit form DOE F 241.4 to the Energy Science and Technology Software Center (ESTSC), 
b.  provide the unique URL on the form for ESTSC to distribute, and
