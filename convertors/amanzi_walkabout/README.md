# particleDriver â€“ Amanzi-Walkabout interface </br>

particleDriver is a C++ program for a particle advection system using Amanzi, LaGriT, and Walkabout. It automates the process of producing input and output files for LaGrit and Walkabout from an Amanzi checkpoint file and creates data for visualization that can be used in Paraview, PlumeCalc, and Meshlab </br>
